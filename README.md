## ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS PROJECT - FOR REAL THIS TIME.

# Start of Project

I have decided to do this section of OTP again because while I understood some facets of the RPS project, I feel like I could have done more on my own. I don't care how long this project takes me to complete, I will do it no matter what.

# End of Project

I felt way more confident doing this the second time around. While I did have to use some online resources for help, I really understood why I needed certain functions for the whole game to work on the console. I was able to break down the overall problem into sub-sections and figure out what I needed to do.

## ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS REVISITED - FOR REAL THIS TIME.

# End

Had to follow an online guide just to get it to work. DOM Manipulation is definitely confusing me, but I will get better with time and practice.
